# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection App

This project is a deep learning-based image classifier designed to detect plant diseases from leaf images using a fine-tuned **MobileNetV2** model. It is deployed as a user-friendly **Streamlit web application**, allowing users to upload images and receive instant diagnostic predictions with visual explanations.
